Web Programming Fall 2017
30 August 2017

	I am a senior Computer Science major. Throughout my college career I have taken several computer science and coding related courses. In addition, I have taken a project class in which I was working on a team developing a web application for the Sojourner Truth Library on campus. I am familiar with Java, C++, Python, and Swift programming languages as well as experience with HTML&CSS, PHP, and Javascript. I am also taking Design for the Web through the art department this semester. 

	I hope to acquire a more in-depth knowledge of web programming and development. I hope to steer my career towards wed development and design. I want to further my knowledge in web scripting, as well as front and backend programming, I also hope to incorporate my experience with art and design to create and develop cutting edge websites and applications in the future.
